Of course. You want a way to manually run the `depot_tools.py` script yourself, rather than having a fully automated script do it for you. This gives you more control and helps in debugging.

The best way to achieve this with Nix is to create a `devShell` in your `flake.nix`. When you run `nix develop`, it will drop you into a special shell that has `python3`, `jq`, `curl`, and all other necessary tools available. It will also provide the path to `depot_tools` in an environment variable for convenience.

Here is the complete `flake.nix` file designed for this manual workflow.

### The Plan

1.  **Add a `devShells` output** to your `flake.nix`.
2.  This shell will include all the tools needed (`python3`, `jq`, `curl`).
3.  We will add a `shellHook` that prints instructions every time you enter the shell.
4.  The instructions will guide you through the exact commands to run `depot_tools.py` manually.

### Step 1: Replace Your `flake.nix`

Replace the entire content of your `flake.nix` with this new version. It keeps your existing `packages` and `apps` but adds the powerful `devShells.default` for your manual workflow.

**File: `flake.nix`**
```nix
{
  description = "SashAI Browser - A standalone flake for development";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/e643668fd71b949c53f8626614b21ff71a07379d";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
    let
      supportedSystems = [ "x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux" ];
      forAllSystems = nixpkgs.lib.genAttrs supportedSystems;
      pkgsFor = forAllSystems (system: import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
      });
    in
    {
      packages = forAllSystems (system:
        let
          pkgs = pkgsFor.${system};
        in
        {
          default = pkgs.callPackage ./default.nix { };
        });

      apps = forAllSystems (system:
        let
          pkgs = pkgsFor.${system};
        in
        {
          default = {
            type = "app";
            program = "${self.packages.${system}.default}/bin/chromium";
          };
          
          update-chromium = {
            type = "app";
            program = "${pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "update-chromium" ''
              #!/usr/bin/env bash
              set -e
              export PATH=${pkgs.git}/bin:$PATH
              ${pkgs.zx}/bin/zx "${self}/update.mjs" --chromium "$@"
            ''}/bin/update-chromium";
          };
        });

      # Development shell for running scripts manually
      devShells = forAllSystems (system:
        let
          pkgs = pkgsFor.${system};
          # Read info.json to get the depot_tools rev/hash for the shell
          sashai-info = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./info.json);
          depot-tools-pkg = pkgs.fetchFromGitiles {
            url = "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git";
            rev = sashai-info.chromium.deps.depot_tools.rev;
            hash = sashai-info.chromium.deps.depot_tools.hash;
          };
        in
        {
          default = pkgs.mkShell {
            packages = [
              # Tools needed to run and manage scripts
              pkgs.python3
              pkgs.jq
              pkgs.curl
              pkgs.git
              pkgs.zx
            ];

            # Set environment variables for the shell
            shellHook = ''
              # Make the depot_tools path easily accessible
              export DEPOT_TOOLS_PATH="${depot-tools-pkg}"
              
              echo "--- SashAI Development Shell ---"
              echo ""
              echo "Welcome! This shell contains the tools to manually update Chromium dependencies."
              echo "The path to depot_tools is available as \$DEPOT_TOOLS_PATH"
              echo ""
              echo "--- MANUAL WORKFLOW TO POPULATE DEPS ---"
              echo ""
              echo "  1. Find the Git commit for your target version (e.g., 142.0.7444.0):"
              echo "     REV=$(curl -sfL "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/142.0.7444.0?format=json" | sed "1d" | jq -r '.commit')"
              echo ""
              echo "  2. Run depot_tools.py with this revision:"
              echo "     python3 ./depot_tools.py \$DEPOT_TOOLS_PATH \$REV > new_deps.json"
              echo ""
              echo "  3. Manually copy the contents of 'new_deps.json' into the 'DEPS' object in 'info.json'."
              echo ""
              echo "-------------------------------------"
            '';
          };
        });

      defaultPackage = self.packages.x86_64-linux.default;
      defaultApp = self.apps.x86_64-linux.default;
    };
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Development Shell

Now you can follow the manual workflow.

1.  **Enter the Shell:**
    Run this command in your project's root directory:
    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```
    You will see the welcome message with instructions, and your command prompt will change, indicating you are inside the special shell.

2.  **Follow the Instructions Printed by the Shell:**
    The workflow is now laid out for you. To populate the DEPS for version `142.0.7444.0`, you will run these commands one by one inside the `nix develop` shell:

    *   **First, find the git revision for your target version:**
        ```bash
        REV=$(curl -sfL "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/142.0.7444.0?format=json" | sed "1d" | jq -r '.commit')
        echo "Found Revision: $REV"
        ```

    *   **Second, run `depot_tools.py` and save the output:**
        The `$DEPOT_TOOLS_PATH` variable is automatically set for you inside the shell.
        ```bash
        python3 ./depot_tools.py $DEPOT_TOOLS_PATH $REV > new_deps.json
        ```
        This command will run for a minute or two and create a `new_deps.json` file containing the complete dependency tree.

3.  **Manually Update `info.json`:**
    *   Open both `info.json` and the new `new_deps.json` file.
    *   Copy the entire JSON object from `new_deps.json`.
    *   In `info.json`, **replace the empty `"DEPS": {}`** with the content you just copied.
    *   Ensure the `rev` for `"src"` inside the new `DEPS` object matches the one you found, and set its `hash` to the dummy hash so you can find it easily.

    Your `info.json`'s `DEPS` section should now look something like this:
    ```json
    "DEPS": {
      "src": {
        "url": "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git",
        "rev": "c7b9b6f6b8e4a9b5f7f1e2d3a4c5b6d7e8f9a0b1",
        "hash": "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=",
        "recompress": true
      },
      "src/v8": {
        "url": "https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git",
        "rev": "...",
        "hash": "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="
      }
      // ... and many more dependencies
    }
    ```

4.  **Exit the Shell and Build:**
    Once your `info.json` is saved, you can leave the development shell by typing `exit`. Now, proceed with the build-and-fix-hashes cycle:
    ```bash
    nix build .#default --keep-failed -L
    ```
